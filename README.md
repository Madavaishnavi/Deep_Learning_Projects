This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a class of artificial neural networks 
designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data such as time series or text. RNNs are uniquely 
capable of processing data inputs with sequential dependence, making them ideal for tasks such 
as weather prediction where current conditions are influenced by past events.
